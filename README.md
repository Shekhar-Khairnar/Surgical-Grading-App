# Surgical Grading App

### Overview
The **Surgical Grading App** is a web-based tool developed using **Streamlit** to enhance the process of grading surgical procedures. The primary objective of this app is to establish a systematic and standardized file management process, addressing the challenges that arose from inconsistent file naming and manual handling of grading data by multiple graders. This app ensures a streamlined approach to file generation, enabling efficient extraction of data for AI modeling.

### The Problem
In the previous workflow, several issues made it difficult to manage and use the grading data effectively:
- **Multiple Graders**: Different graders were involved in evaluating the same subjects, which led to variations in file names and formatting.
- **Inconsistent File Naming**: Due to the lack of a uniform naming convention, files were disorganized, making it challenging to track grading data for specific subjects or procedures.
- **Manual Corrections**: The irregular file names required manual intervention to correct and organize the files, which significantly delayed the process of preparing the data for AI modeling.
- **Time-Intensive Data Management**: Sorting through inconsistent files and performing manual corrections was a time-consuming process that introduced potential errors.

### The Solution
The **Surgical Grading App** provides a structured solution to these issues:
- **Standardized File Naming**: The app enforces a consistent naming convention for all grading files, ensuring that files from multiple graders follow the same format.
- **Automated File Creation**: By automating the grading process, the app eliminates the need for manual file handling, reducing errors and saving time.
- **Efficient Data Management**: The app maintains a standardized format for each file, simplifying the extraction of data for AI modeling and improving overall workflow efficiency.
- **Future-Proofing**: This solution ensures that future data collection follows a systematic and consistent approach, making it easier to integrate with AI and machine learning models.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Task Management**: Users can add, remove, and archive tasks within the app, ensuring flexibility and control over the grading process.
- **File Export**: Grading data can be easily exported in CSV format, following a strict naming convention that facilitates future use.
- **Local File Storage**: All generated files are stored locally, ensuring that data remains under the user's control without relying on cloud storage.
- **Seamless Data Preparation**: The appâ€™s structured output is optimized for integration with AI modeling, reducing the need for manual data preprocessing.
